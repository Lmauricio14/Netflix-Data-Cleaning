# Netflix-Data-Cleaning
This repository houses a Python-based data cleaning toolkit for Netflix datasets. The focus is on preparing data for analytical projects by addressing common issues such as missing values, incorrect data types, and redundant information.

### Python Scripts for Data Transformation
Contained within are Python scripts that demonstrate the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing the Netflix dataset for deeper analysis. These scripts leverage Python's powerful data manipulation libraries to ensure that your data is analysis-ready.

### Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the scripts on your own Netflix dataset to perform data cleaning tasks.

### Contribution and Use
Contributions to improve the scripts or extend their functionality are welcome. Please submit a pull request or an issue if you have suggestions or requests.

This toolkit is perfect for data analysts, scientists, and enthusiasts looking to refine their data cleaning skills with real-world data.

Happy data cleaning!
